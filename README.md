# Python-MvsL
My goal is to port Mario vs Luigi to Python! (Or at least try to)

# Note for contributors!
If you would like to help out, you're more than welcome to. However, please remember that this project was intended to be a Python challenge for myself! So, any changes to my code (that I see as just "preference" changes, and not bug fixes/redundancy removing) might be rejected!
